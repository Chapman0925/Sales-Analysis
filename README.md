# Sales-Analysis

This project consists hundred thousands of data for the electronics store's sales in 2019.

In this project I will be using Python Pandas, Matplot and Seaborn Libraries.

Step1: I combined all the csv files into one final csv file as the raw csv file were seperated by different month. By combining it , it can increase the efficiency of our analysis.

Step 2 ( Data Cleaning ): I clean the data by dropping the null values & removing some of the rows because some rows consists of incorrect datas and I utilize the panda library to change the datatype for certain features of the dataset.

Step 3 ( Date Exploration ) : I tried to answer some business question based on our dataset

1. Which Month has the best sales and how much was the earnning in that month?

2. Which City has the most quantity ordered?

3. When should the company display their advertising to maximize their profit?

4. What products are most often sold together?

5. Which Product have sold the most often?
